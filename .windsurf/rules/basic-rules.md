## Basics
- Be careful reading multiple files to avoid context overflow.
- Always search for the proper import sources and names before adding them.
- Always search for class composition and module, and function definition before using them.
- Always keep unfinished todo items in your todo list.
- Create or open an implementation plan file for your work before you start implementing and update it as you go.

## ToDo List
- Never remove incomplete todo items.
- Add newly created todo items to the todo list.
- Rearrange todo items to keep them in a logical order if new todo items are added.

## Planning and Implementation
- The task formulation should be specific, and have all the details and constrains required to properly implement it.
- If new tasks and subtasks appear, add them to the plan file.
- Use the following marks for tasks and features:
  - `[x]` for completed tasks.
  - `âœ…` for completed features.
  - `[ ]` for incompleted tasks.
- Always update the plan file as you move forward with completed and new tasks.
- Decompose complex components tasks into subcomponents.
- Use the following template for the plan file:
  ```
